       MWI Device State Subscriptions 
===========================================

Updates voice mail hints created by FreePBX.

FreePBX has an option to create voicemail hints allowing a BLF to monitor
any mailbox.

Unfortunately, the module to update the hints is not part of Asterisk. It is 
provided in the official FreePBX distro as a patch to the distro Asterisk build.

This res_mwi_devstate.c was extracted from the FreePBX disto source rpm at:
http://yum.freepbxdistro.org/pbx/SRPMS/asterisk/13/asterisk13-13.7.2-1.shmz65.1.94.src.rpm

A Makefile has been added to build and install the module standalone.
